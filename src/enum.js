 * This is the common base class for all enumeration types. Enum constants are
 * immutable; once declared they can't be modified.
 * 
 * Enum types are iterable, that's to say, they inherit a [Symbol.iterator]
 * method implemented by this class. Therefore, enum types may be used in "for
 * of" blocks in order to iterate over its declared constants.
 * 
 * @property {string} name - The name of the enum constant, exactly as declared
 *           in the enum declaration.
 * @property {number} ordinal - An integer indicating the ordinal of this
 *           enumeration constant (its position in its enum declaration, where
 *           the initial constant is assigned a value of zero).
 * @property {string} type A string representing the type of this constant
 *           (actually, the name of the class that this constant extends from).
 * @property {string} _ An alias to {@link Enum.toString}. This property offers
 *           a short and convenient way of obtaining the string representation
 *           of this constant.
